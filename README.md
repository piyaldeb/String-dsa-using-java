# String-dsa-using-java
A Java string is a sequence of characters that exist as an object of the class java.lang. Java strings are created and manipulated through the string class. Once created, a string is immutable -- its value cannot be changed.

methods of class String enable:

Examining individual characters in the string.
Comparing strings.
Searching strings.
Copying strings with characters converted from upper to lower case or vice versa.
Strings can be created simply. For example:

String greeting = "Hello world!";
"Hello world!" in that example is a string literal, defined by the double quotes, which means that the compiler will create an object with that value.
